# Activities_Templates
Templates for Java activities we will do in class. Make a branch from this to which you will submit the activity.

# How To Submit an Activity
At the beggining of the year all programmers will make a branch on this repository, with the name [Firstname][Lastname]\_Activites.
To submit an activity, make the changes on your computer then pull request it to your branch.
Whenever a new activity is made, we will push it to the main branch, and everyone needs to pull it to their branch to work on.
