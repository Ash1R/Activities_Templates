# Activities
These are templates for Java activities we will do in class.
At the beggining of the year all programmers will make a branch on this repository, with the name [Firstname][Lastname]\_Activites.
All of the changes you need to make will be marked with a comment like this: //TODO: lorem ipsum
So, YOU DO NOT NEED TO MAKE CHANGES UNLESS THERE IS A TODO: COMMENT THERE
To submit an activity, make the changes on your computer then pull request it to your branch.
Whenever a new activity is made, we will push it to the main branch, and everyone needs to pull it to their branch to work on.
